The range() function in python is used to generate a sequence of number. 

We can also specify the start, stop and step-size as follows: 

range(start, stop, step_size) # step_size is usually not used with range() 

AN EXAMPLE  DEMONSTRATING  RANGE () FUNCTION.  
 for i in range(0,7): # range(7) can also be used. 
    print(i) # prints 0 to 6
    
'''

for i in range(0,6):
    print(i)


for i in range(0,50,10):
    print(i, end=" ")
