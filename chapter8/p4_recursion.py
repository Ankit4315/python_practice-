# Recursion is a function which calls itself. 
# It is used to directly use a mathematical formula as function.


'''

factorial(n) = n x factorial (n-1) 
This function can be defined as follows: 
def factorial(n) 
    if i == 0 or i==1: # base condition which doesn't call the function 
any further 
    return 1 
else: 
    return n*factorial(n-1) # function calling itself
    
'''

n = int(input("enter a  n umber :> "))

def fact(n):
    if(n==1 or n== 0):
        return 1
    return n * fact(n-1)

print(fact(n))

The programmer needs to be extremely careful while working with recursion to ensure 
that the function doesnâ€™t infinitely keep calling itself. Recursion is sometimes the most 
direct way to code an algorithm.
