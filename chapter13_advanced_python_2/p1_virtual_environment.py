# VIRTUAL ENVIRIO NMENT 

'''
An environment which is same as the system interpreter but is isolated from the other 
Python environments on the system. 
'''

# INSTALLATION  

'''
To use virtual environments, we write: 
pip install virtualenv 
'''

# virtualenv myprojectenv # Creates a new venv 

# python -m venv myprojectenv   #  to run the env 


'''
The next step after creating the virtual environment is to activate it. 
We can now use this virtual environment as a separate Python installation.
