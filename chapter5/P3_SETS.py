# Set is a collection of non-repetitive elements. 

s = set()           # no repetition allowed!  , empty set
s.add(1) 
s.add(2)           # or set ={1,2} 
 
 
# if you are a programming beginner without much knowledge of mathematical 
# operations on sets, you can simply look at sets in python as data types containing 
# unique values

# PROPERTIES OF SETS 

# 1. Sets are unordered => Element’s order doesn’t matter 
# 2. Sets are unindexed => Cannot access elements by index 
# 3. There is no way to change items in sets. 
# 4. Sets cannot contain duplicate values.
